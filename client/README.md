# Volunteer Website Application
**Carter Ung, Nathan Turen, Dion Olumese, Kelsey Wong**

## Setup 
To build `node modules` run `npm install` on cloned repository. Next, you can build the application using `npm run build`. 

You can run the website locally using `npm start`. 

## Adding Features
We use the [Materials UI Component Library](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) to generate props and components such as Buttons, Inputs, etc. Please reference this library for local frontend development.
